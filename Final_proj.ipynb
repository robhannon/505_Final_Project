How would you describe this group of guys to people that arent familiar with the Pelicans in terms of how much fun you guys have and kind of the bond and some of the entertaining stuff that you do throughout the season?\n",
            "Answer 2:    Goofy.  We come to work we all have fun.  Off the court on the court we all have fun.  Were all around the same age.\n",

            "Answer 4:    For me I think my motivating factor is just seeing my teammates really getting ready for these games.  Like this is a different approach.  You see some of my teammates getting  some of them that dont get extra shots after the game theyre really locked in and getting extra shots after shootaround or after practice.  Its just like a different feel.\n",

Have you been surprised how quickly its picked up around the league and other guys around the league have been invested in it as fast as everybody has been?\n",
            "Answer 8:    I mean Im not surprised because everybody loves competing for something especially with all the talent thats in the league.  You see how the Lakers came out last night and how Phoenix fought back in that second half last night.\n",

Compared to the atmosphere that you expect in November and December how much fun has it been to play in some of these InSeason Tournament games the game Monday in Sacramento but also the games in New Orleans and how much are you looking forward to tomorrow nights atmosphere?\n",

            "Answer 11: CJ McCOLLUM   I was very confident.  I felt like we had a really good chance of taking advantage of the opportunity in front of us with the preparation with us having a more healthy roster.  And as a person with his own wine brand McCollum Heritage 91 it just made sense for me to travel with my own wine.  If you need some I have some in my suitcase.  Ill make sure you get some because you asked the question.  I have the pinot with me right now.  I have the chardonnay.  I have the blanc de blanc as well as the ros.  So I got you.  And if you want more you can purchase some at McCollumHeritage91.com.\n",

            "Answer 12: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah well unfortunately I wasnt able to play in the actual leadup of the tournament.  I was watching at home and then was able to come back and see the game against Denver.  But its been a really cool experience for all of our guys to play in meaningful games with the stakes obviously the financial incentive.  The ability to be able to compete on a big stage where theres only InSeason Tournament games being played against quality playoff opponents.  It was fun to play on the road in Sacramento against a really good team who plays fast who executes who has playoff experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 13: Obviously in your role with the Players Association youre involved in conversations about events like this and plans for the league moving forward.  From your perspective how do you think this has played out overall and what are some things youd like to see tweaked to improve it more next year?\n",
            "Answer 13: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah I think its been a success.  I think if you look at the way its been perceived you look at how the players have played the types of games weve gotten  weve had buzzer beaters weve had star power performing at a high level.\n",

            "Question 14: From your days of playing NBA Summer League here in Las Vegas can you talk a little bit about your relationship with this city and your thoughts of having these games played here in Las Vegas?\n",
            "Answer 14: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah I think its been really cool.  As a kid you watch Vegas Summer League and you envision yourself being able to play out there after youre drafted. Having played in Summer League for a few years and then coming essentially every summer to watch games do some TV and things of that nature its been a really cool transformation for myself.  Ive never been to Vegas in December so to be able to see what the city is like in December has been cool.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 15: Youve mentioned the financial incentive a couple of times.  Do you know what you would do with the prize money if you win it all?\n",
            "Answer 15: CJ McCOLLUM   Id invest some of it and probably give some to some of the charities Im a part of and associated with.  But I think the good news is that theres a lot of players on all of our teams  I think Dame talked about it  who arent fortunate to make as much money as some of the guys that are high paid.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 16: I know you have two games left to win but if the Pelicans were to win the InSeason Tournament how would you want to see the organization celebrate that?  Would you want a ring?  Would you want a banner?  What do you think would be appropriate?\n",
            "Answer 16: CJ McCOLLUM   Geez well I hope we throw a really good party.  But also I think a banner I guess.  Wed have won three games in the Knockout Rounds?  I dont know thats a great question that I havent really thought about.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 17: You mentioned about the InSeason Tournament potentially being in Miami.  Can you see it being in different locations?  And how scary is this team?  I feel like we havent seen this team healthy but now that were starting to how dangerous do you feel like this team is?\n",
            "Answer 17: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah Ill answer the first question.  I think the great thing about our partnership with Adam and the NBA is that theyre always receptive to feedback and willing to make changes or things that are helpful for the game and our players and our fans.  So I think anything is possible in terms of locations as we continue to progress.  Obviously Vegas has been great to us and we enjoy it. But I think anything can be reevaluated depending on feedback we receive from the collective group.\n",

            "Question 18: How much do you want to beat Dame in the Finals?\n",
            "Answer 18: CJ McCOLLUM   Thats my guy.  Ill see my guy tonight and give him some wine.  But I think it would be cool to make it to the Finals first and foremost.  Were competitors were friends.  I think fans would probably enjoy it and it would be a really good matchup for both of our teams.  But I just want to win.  I really dont care who its against personally.  I would definitely make him post my wine or something like that after we won.\n",

            "Answer 19:    Its incredible what hes doing.  Right now Im 42 so he cant be too far behind me.  To be playing at such a high level at  is this 22 years or 21 years?  Playing at such a high level 21 years in the NBA his impact on the game on the younger generation has been incredible and its amazing to see.\n",

            "Answer 21:    The games theyve been a lot of fun.  I think the NBA has done a great job of providing a platform that allows high competitive meaningful games during the regular season and all of our guys  I think all of us we didnt know what to expect to be honest with you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 22: Last time you were involved in fighting for a title was with the Suns in 2021.  What did you learn from that experience and what can you apply from that experience?\n",
            "Answer 22:    The biggest thing going through those type of experiences is the journey is what it takes to get there.  All of the film work the player development time the practice time the team dinners on the road working with the performance staff doing all the little things and building the relationships and camaraderie with your teammates coaches front office it makes you stronger.\n",

            "Answer 23:    Well our mentality right now is were relishing in the positives that theyve already done.  Before we can even get to improvements we want to digest what we are experiencing.  Its hard to digest it right now because were in it.\n",

            "Question 24: As a guy whos obviously been around the league for a long time it seems like this thing has picked up a lot of momentum within the league faster than maybe anybody would have guessed.  Has that been the case for you and why do you think thats been the case?\n",
            "Answer 24:    Its definitely been the case for myself and our team.  A lot of hard work goes into providing this type of platform and Im grateful for the hearts and the minds that it takes to be willing to make some changes.  Thats what its about.  Thats what the NBA is about and were grateful to be a team thats a part of this.\n",

            "Question 25: I feel like you guys are a very scary team because you guys are just now starting to get healthy.  Trey Murphy is getting rolling Herb Jones is really getting rolling offensively too as well.  Two I wanted to ask about your team coming together and now being healthy.  Ive been talking to a lot of coaches and they bring you up as a coach that draws up a lot of good sets circle pins.  A lot of people tell me to watch your sets that you run.  You being a former player where did you get that from in terms of being able to draw up good sets and people watching your work?\n",
            "Answer 25:    Yeah for sure.  To answer the first part of the question were capable right now.  We dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves.  We know theres a ton of work that goes into being a really good team in the NBA and being consistent and winning consistently.  Those are the things that were working on.\n",

            "Answer 26:    A lot of it has to do with the different characteristics of our players.  So we tailor most of our ATOs around who they are and how we can get them the best quality shot for sure.\n",

I think its going to be really cool for the exposure just for our organization more national exposure at that. Yeah Ive got no complaints.

            "Answer 31:    Yeah I think the way our culture is set up guys are always together.  I think thats a big part of the Association building that camaraderie with your team.  Guys were up and active ready to go this morning.  We got a good lift in yesterday.  Yeah it kind of does feel like Summer League just kind of the feel of everything just being together at all times.\n",

            "Answer 32:    Yeah somewhat.  Its still very early.  This is what its good for right now being battle tested.  For guys like myself whos been to the Playoffs you know what that level that intensity what it feels like but for the guys that havent you never know until they actually get there.  So when they have these reps this early in the season and exposure like this or longer days like that even like the longer media timeouts stuff you dont typically see its really good for that.\n",

Do you think maybe this is his year the year of Tyrese Haliburton and maybe the year when he can turn into one of the big stars of the league?\n",
            "Answer 33:    Yeah its a slippery slope with that.  I think Tyrese had his first AllStar berth last year and he got a taste of what thats like after the Team USA stuff this past summer.  I think for him everything is about winning.  I think hes made that kind of super clear with everything.  I respect that being really even keel.\n",

And then two you guys had some moments you and Tyrese in terms of chemistry.  Jrue kind of veers out on the pickandroll and then you wouldnt set the pick you would kind of veer out.  Just wanted to ask you about that.  Was that something you guys went over?  I think Tyrese did a doublecross out of it and then you wouldnt even set the screen you kind of knew that move was coming.  Did you talk about that before too as well?\n",

            "Answer 35:    It was unreal.  I personally hadnt seen Gainbridge rocking like that in the past three to four years since weve been to the actual playoff environment.  But whats that decibel thing called?  Im sure that was off the charts man like jet enginetype stuff.  It was amazing in there.\n",

For someone whos seen the organization go as much as its gone through the highs and lows the ups and downs the rebuilds to where we are now its a little bit of fruit of your labors.

Whats that been like to experience that this week?\n",

Like we talked about all year the better we play the more love were going to get and youve got to take that in stride but understand that can be a poison to a sense at the same time.

            "Answer 44:    Yeah Im curious to see what changes next year.  I would assume that the league would probably like more teams to be in Vegas.  But at the same time just to avoid the tiebreaker kind of mess that was going on.  Everybody was like if who wins what happens.  I think maybe playing a couple more games maybe outside of your group maybe in the other conference something like that. Just playing more games to have more different scenarios with tiebreakers and make it make a little more sense.  Im curious to see what it looks like next year for sure.\n",

I think we all are NBA fans first and foremost so weve all seen it watched it watched our favorite players do it so to be a part of it is pretty cool.  To get a taste to be playing on national TV and stuff like that is cool.  You just want to keep doing it and youve got to win to do that at the end of the day.\n",

A lot of people in the league feel like this is probably where the league would move to if expansion happened or anything like that.  I think everybody would love that because who doesnt love Vegas.

And then youre shooting 40 percent from threepoint range in college and also now do you still have that in the back of your mind going out there playing with a crazy chip on your shoulder?\n",
            "Answer 47:    Yeah for sure.  I think all the greats do.  They find the things that give them a little bit of an edge so Im just relishing in that moment and relishing that I was a nostar recruit in high school.

It does seem like across the league interest was high on the court with the players.  Is the motivation to win something thats new?  Is it the prize money?  Youve talked at length about how you havent won anything in a long time.  Im curious what you think the motivation leaguewide is for this tournament.\n",

            "Answer 51:    Yeah I think thats just part of what theyve built over there.  Thats the reason they won a championship is because youve got a guy like Giannis who can get downhill put so much pressure on the rim and you surround him with shooters all over the floor that poses a really difficult threat when defending them.\n",

Theyve got a whole banner thing the size of one of the sides of the building that has all four teams printed on it.  They must have done that 13 hours ago or something unless they just printed up a bunch of different combinations.  But thats impressive.\n",

Coming now to a neutral venue it remains to be seen exactly how its going to be.  I do expect some buzz.  I expect the energy from the teams to be great.\n",

Hes shooting 40 percent from threepoint range in his career in the NBA lookoff passes can do it all.  Where do you see him taking that leap and getting the credit he deserves?  Talk a little bit about that.\n",
            "Answer 57:    Yeah when youre a young player in this league and youre trying to move your team up the ladder these kinds of meaningful games are extremely important because what young teams find out eventually when they get into a playoff environment is that its only about this possession the next possession whats going on whistle to whistle.  How can we collectively do everything possible to put ourselves in a position to be successful at the end of the game at the end of the series.\n",

            "Answer 58:    Yeah theyre better.  Theyre better.  Lillard being out was a break that we caught on that particular night on the one hand that he wasnt out there.  On the other hand Giannis touched the ball 65 times in the game.\n",

            "Answer 59:    Well its four teams that are playing for the Cup so Im not trying to get too much into acronyms or metaphors or anything like that. But this is the first InSeason Tournament its the first NBA Cup.  The level of interest has been phenomenally high.  Were coming in here with guns blazing.  Thats how weve got to play.

In terms of emptying the tank with LeBron in a single elimination game like this is this playoff level willingness?  Is it regular season level willingness or is it somewhere in between how hard youre willing to do with your top players?\n",
            "Answer 60:    You know I think its somewhere in between for sure.  Again I think its fun too to have  it wasnt fun being in the moment but its intense highly intense in the moment but in terms of trying to manage your star players and be efficient with their workload  its two things.  If theyre managing anything physically thats not really preventing them from playing but also something you need to be on the lookout for coupled with their performance.  Its easy to say oh just play them this many amount of minutes but if theyre out there tearing it up its tough.  You dont want to take them out neither do they want to come out.\n",

Do you think youll use some of these matchups to actually maybe scout because of the added intensity maybe something you can use down the line even though its game 23 24 of the regular season?\n",
            "Answer 61:    Yeah every game we play we have our designated sections on both sides of the ball our themes that we keep in a database whenever we need to pull something out and illustrate something to the team or think about a different coverage or a different play call.  We already have that in our database.\n",

Theyre a wellbalanced team in my opinion and theyve dealt with some injury issues and they seem to be coming back whole.  Larry Nance is not out there right now but some of their other guys Trey Murphy is back Alvarado CJ obviously but theyre a wellbalanced team.  They reflect their coach just hardnosed and just go about his business and doesnt try to draw too much crazy attention to himself and just go out there and make plays.\n",

How much do you feel like this tournament has forced teams to be ready from the getgo because at the end of the tournament theres a big incentive whether the NBA Cup or the monetary incentive?\n",
            "Answer 63:    Really its a little precursor I think for anybody that hasnt had the opportunity to participate in it and those who have the competitive spirit the intensity is very reflective of the playoffs.  When you think about it I think some of the games Ive watched from around the league how intense they are going down to the wire I think again you have a trophy that you can win you have a big purse that you can win.  Youve really got to be on your game and its similar  its funny its a split between the NBA and the NCAA with the tournament style setup.\n",

            "Answer 64:    I mean I dont think about all that stuff really to be honest man.  I just think we try to take care of whats in front of us.  Right now its a nongame day so recovery and film study was the priority.  Tomorrow the game will obviously be the priority.  Were just trying to  were getting healthy bodies back so were just trying to build continuity and build the best possible rhythm and not skip any steps.

Do you think that would potentially be a good idea also?\n",
            "Answer 67:    Possibly.  Possibly thats something definitely that should be looked at.  Maybe its some type of draft competition as well as the purse I dont know something like that.  I think it would be cool.\n",

We talk a lot about AD but the perimeter defense Max Vando Cam Taurean their ability and being able to see that group finally because I know a lot of guys have been hurt what are some things youre starting to see with this team in terms of how good you guys have been defensively?  They did a great job on Book did a great job on KD.  Give me your thoughts on how good this group can be defensively.\n",

We want to create a defensive juggernaut if you will like to try to go out and find some long athletic tough wings that we can really get stops.\n",

            "Answer 69:    I just think the ability to not have to scheme.  I mean obviously youre going to have a counter or youre going to mix up pitches whatever metaphor you want to use but to be able to go into a game and start out a game and not have to doubleteam unless you choose to and our doubleteams have been really highquality been very beneficial to our defense but that says if youre able to go into a game and able to play people straight up that creates balance on the defensive end of the floor for your team.

Knowing how hard that is for those players across all teams what kind of opportunity is this for those players not only just trying to make a living but also to get this kind of experience?\n",

In his mind this was going to be his last season.  Hes going to have a great year put himself in a position to go chase his dreams in the NFL.

Was there a moment when you saw that in this group?\n",

Its some new excitement and you know its a surprise in the end that everybody is kind of hunting for and then you look at the trip to Vegas and they roll out the red carpet.

I think its one of those moments where its not like everything because were going to continue to play but we were playing to stay here you know for the game Saturday.  You know you want an opportunity to win the prize and you want that for your younger teammates you want to extend your week here and just continue to be part of the event.

Weve got to try and find a body.  You know they are crashing and I thought we did a good job in the second half taking the threes out and I think that was critical.

You know Haliburton hes  you know hes exceptional in pickandrolls so we were just trying to switch up our coverages a little bit.  I thought you know the zone got us back in and I think if we would have rebounded a little bit better probably a different outcome.  They are a good team very wellcoached team.

I thought a couple times we let them get behind us even off made baskets and I think one off a free throw if Im not mistaken.  Those youve got to take those off the board.  You cant give this team those type of points.  Youve got to make them earn it.

Its always good to play for another trophy during the season.  Pretty much thats it.  Obviously now overseas they do it.  I know the G League does it.  It was kind of strange when I came around here 10 years ago that the NBA wasnt doing that.  It was only the Championship.  But I think it just brings a lot of meaning to the games and if you play a game like this at 200 p.m. 200 p.m here 400 p.m. in Milwaukee 1000 p.m. in Greece people stay up and watch the game.  It was fun.  Fun experience.  Happy that we were able to make Vegas in the first year it happened.  Obviously we didnt go to the Final game but at the end of the day you know you live you learn.  Hopefully you can get  learn from this game and be better in the future.\n",

            "Answer 179:    The team.  We have to be more organized.  We have to know what we are trying to get down the stretch.  You know at the end of the day like down the stretch its about effort man.  Its about effort and attitude you have to go out there and take it.  I feel like the Indiana team thats what they did.  They crashed the board got defensive rebounds.  You know they got to their spots.  They played great defense.  You know got deflections.  Like at the end of the day like nothing is going to be given to you in life.  Nothing is going to be given to you in an NBA game and we cannot just expect that to be we run a play and because we run the play we are going to score a bucket.  Like youve got to execute.  Youve got to cut hard screen harder get open drive the ball you know make something happen.\n",

Was it a function of the zone and maybe losing sense of where they were or what did you  how did you see them be able to kind of take advantage of that in the second half?\n",
            "Answer 180:    Played harder than us.  Simple as that.  Obviously playing the zone youre not guarding youre just guarding like an area.  Try to keep  have a guy in front of you.  And sometimes when the ball goes up obviously if you try to find a body to get back you know to kind of crack a body but at the end of the day I dont even think that was the case.  I think they just played harder than us and weve just got to accept it.\n",

            "Answer 185:    Yeah Ill say obviously the talent level that we have is incredible.  But we have to be more organized.  We have to be more organized.  I feel like sometimes were not organized at all.  We dont know what we try to get from our offense or sometimes defensively were not sprinting back.  We dont  we create a lot of  shoot a lot of early threes. At the end of the day you have to protect the ball.  You have to know where the ball is.  We had a lot of situations today that they got a lot of dunks open threes early threes.  We have to be better.  And the other thing is that obviously our chemistry gamebygame going to keep on getting closer.  Again because we have new players on the team Malik and Dame which weve played a lot of years in the previous years with the same basically core and now its different.  We have to know what their weaknesses are what their strengths are where they want the ball what spots on the floor they want the ball and the biggest thing I believe is that we got to  weve got to want it.

            "Answer 188:    Our messages was simple it took a lot to get to this point.  We gave them a ton of credit and let them know that that does not go unnoticed the games that we had to win the tough game in Sacramento.  But tonight was a total let down.  We were all disappointed in our competitive spirit against the Lakers.  You got to give them credit they came out and they dominated.\n",

Im not going to take anything away from the Lakers they came out and they dominated wire to wire.

            "Answer 190:    We got to continue to trust pretty much.  When the game gets hard when teams pick up their physicality you have to execute at an even higher level.  We started to go away from that on both ends of the floor and that becomes deflating when we try to do it by ourselves.\n",

What kind of extra levers can you pull here to put him in better positions to be that true No. 1 kind of like life blood of a winning postseason team here?\n",
            "Answer 191:    Yeah experience is key for us right now.  We havent had the experiences that the Lakers have.  They know what it takes to win games like that.  They know what it takes to be on the big stage and have big moments.  For some of our guys this is their first time since college being in elimination games.\n",

            "Answer 192:    Yeah tonight wasnt our night obviously offensively defensively.  Ive said it before the Lakers they have that experience.  You saw LeBron on full display.  He understands these moments.  We got a young team that will eventually get there but tonight was not our night were all disappointed in it and well go home well regroup and continue to improve from here.\n",

            "Answer 193:    Well he has to get the ball in different ways number one transition.  So rebound the ball you can push before their defense is set thats a way that we can attack.  Sometimes in pickandrolls being able to set the screen dive now you catch it on the move now it kind of frees him up to be able to score a little bit more in our half court.\n",

            "Answer 195:    I just think that we have a lot of bodies.  A lot of long athletic wings and players where we can switch randomly.  We can switch deliberately.  AD is a huge huge factor.  Backing up and anchoring the back line of our defense it allows Bron and Cam and Taurean and Rui everybody Austin DLo everybody Max to just play free and be aggressive. The biggest thing we talk about is again playing with multiple efforts trying to have multiple efforts.  Strategies defensively they are not always going to be perfect.  So you cant get discouraged.  You just have to play with energy.  Energy most times most instances they cover up the technical mistakes. So we have a lot of that.\n",

I wonder if you can remember the first conversations you had with maybe your leaders of the team Anthony and LeBron about what we want to do as a group in this thing how we want to approach it.  Was there any kind of galvanizing conversations where you all decided like hey this is something we really want to prioritize and go for?\n",

            "Answer 198:    I mean we got guys that are hawks and hes right back there along with AD communicating coverages and yelling out switches.  He switched a couple times.  We had a random blitz in there.  They hurt us early in the first quarter with rebounds and we were turning the ball over a little bit.  We were able to clean that up in the second quarter.\n",

            "Answer 199:    No thoughts.  Definitely no recipe.  I would just say its refreshing to see a young player of his magnitude.  Hes had a hell of a year past 12 months being named an AllStar being selected to the USA team.  Hes just out there hooping.  I watched a little bit of that game today.

            "Answer 200:    I mean the thing Im starting to see is when we lock in and everybody is pulling the rope in the same direction and everybody is focused on the objectives within the game plan and the strategy that we are using to attack these teams on both sides of the ball and when we sacrifice one another we are damn near unstoppable.\n",

Youre starting to get a glimpse of maybe what the next four or five months could look like for this team?\n",

I think we are starting to get a feel for who we need to become as a team in order for us to win basketball games and be consistent.  We know that defensively we are starting to really really tap into that like okay we got to defend every single night.  And when we defend we are going to give ourselves a chance to win every night.  I think when you got guys on a string youve got guys communicating defensively you might have a breakdown here but then youve got one of your teammates on the back line that is picking up for you it brings a lot of good mojo to the team.\n",

I have a problem where I literally just try to hunt the best shot possible every time but my teammates they expect more from me I expect more from myself and I got to just trust my game.

Like Bron said for Adam to be able to put the situation in the season like that and not lose a step is good for the game.  And obviously any city thats playing in PlayIn games you can be in Detroit or wherever those fans are going to come out.  So I think its huge for the game.

Why do you feel like people cant get to that move because you get to the paint all the time with that?  Then also with your shooting form you do a lot of rapid fire where you get your shot off super fast.  Do people try to tweak your shot?  Even with your percentages that they are so efficient do you feel like just telling players you dont have to have the most perfect form to be able to shoot the ball at an efficient clip and get your shot off fast as well?\n",

I almost missed the defensive call but I came and I hit the ball.  They were showing on film that they were kind of loose with the ball when they were in the pocket.  I hit the ball.

It was something we had to knock them down make sure that time hit triple zero.  That last possession leading up to the QB sneak where they fell short it was frantic to be honest with you just to make sure they didnt get in was just our main objective and it was a crazy last drive.\n",

The 2020 game when we played at Michie Stadium they had a 1st and goal at the 2 or the 1yard line or something.  We had four plays in a row and we stopped them.  I dont know if itll live forever.

One thing about this game thats different than anybody else playing a college football game is there arent any transfers out there.  Theres not one.  No transfers.  Nobody that was playing on their team nobody that was playing on our team played at another college before they came here.  Our guys grow up in our program.  They come in as freshmen we develop them they grow up through the program they play together sophomores juniors and take the field for the last time tonight as seniors.  Its pretty special.

They were still getting their call and Tyson did a good job of not drawing too much attention to himself.  He did say hey throw it throw it and I was trying to get our guys lined up so I could snap the ball and get it to him.

They were confident in the game plan as well and its pretty cool seeing a freshman center lead the way behind guys like Connor Finucane who played a lot of ball Jackson Filipowicz and they were moving them back and allowing Kanye and myself and all the other running backs to get some big runs.  To be able to run for over 200 on Navy is no small feat because they have a great run defense.  Its really cool that we ran the ball so successfully today.\n",

Talking to past quarterbacks who played ArmyNavy game they told me just once you get out there take it all in and getting to play at a place like Gillette with so much rich history with a quarterback like Tom Brady I was looking around and seeing all the greatness that had played there.

After the defense made that stop there was three seconds on the clock and they just told me to run around and when they got close or when the clock hit zero to run out the back of the end zone to secure the win.

Saw it they did it twice and great defense and makes your job a lot easier on the offensive side.

With Izzy those two matches you lost late that he referenced earlier was there anything you learned from those matches  I know they were both on the road  that kind of helped propel you guys where you are now?\n",

Not only is our front court tall and great blockers with a lot of speed but our back court also does a lot of work back there that doesnt get as much recognition but I think deserves it.\n",

            "Answer 526:    To be in the presence of pirates is pretty cool.  The club kids I mean that was awesome.  I think anytime that you can get people to dream big things is  to walk off the plane and see a bunch of younger players that were there  and Im sure these guys were thinking about being their age and what that could be like sitting outside of a plane and watching people you look up to that are playing the game at the highest level coming down and having that moment.

But really its like this is the dream.  Youre a young girl playing club and this is the stage you want to get to.

You have to try to isolate them oneonone so we were trying to go short string short sets.

Sometimes you dont know these things in realtime but we kind of see what weve got here but is this college volleyballs moment were going to have tomorrow?\n",
            "Answer 796:    This is probably the biggest moment weve ever had.  Its a moment that  for ABC to see where the sport is growing to pick it up on football Sunday is pretty special.  Hopefully theres some marketing behind that to be able to make that happen.\n",

Like for even the start that we had if we wouldnt have had the hiccup against Kansas State we probably would have been a top four seed.

            "Answer 803: ASJIA ONEAL   I would say it would be the same because obviously its for a National Championship but I do know that theres that longterm rivalry there.

            "Answer 805:    Each defense that there is theres tendencies from a player.  Theres heat maps that Nebraska will all have and well have on them.  At the end of the day its being able to see the floor.  The way that Madi swung out of system against Stanford they really didnt have an answer.

            "Answer 807: ASJIA ONEAL   I honestly try not to think about it too much because I feel like as athletes you dont like to focus on weak moments or things like that.  Really just throughout the long season when you go through your dog days or days you dont want to wake up and go to practice or lift those are times when I reflect on when I didnt really have the possibility or capability to go through the workouts or the practices I had.\n",

            "Answer 808:    I definitely think the game is a lot faster.  That wasnt the biggest adjustment.  I think the biggest adjustment is just learning how to play with new girls that have played in National Championships won National Championships and just have high expectations like you but you just want to be the best that you can be for them.\n",

Emma is a player that  you have players that make constant decisions whether to work hard or not or to go for balls.  Emma has never had a day off like that.

Hes is not going to be perfect but he doesnt need to be.

We have some talented players on our side of the ball and our defensive coaches have done a good job all year long of putting those guys in positions to make plays but I think its going to be a strength against a strength so thats going to be a big test for us tomorrow.\n",

We were talking as a defensive staff and a whole staff just being able to see how hes been able to work through guys being injured and create a plan offensively and the whole team but focused on what they do offensively and its been fun.

We took our guys that were on staff and basically promoted them for the week and a couple guys  it started actually the week before because we had to put guys on the road because we were down coaches on the road.

I think all people throughout college football that COVID time I think there was a bonding and a grouping and all these guys that weathered that storm were not playing its canceled what are we going to do now its back on we are going to play games but were not going to have any fans.\n",

            "Answer 828:    I think they do the little things you have to do to win football games.  They dont turn the ball over.  They dont have a lot of selfinflicted wounds.  They play downhill football.  Theyre usually not behind in the chains.  Theyre not in a lot of 3rd and longs a lot of 2nd and longs.  They create a lot of 2nd and longs and they create a lot of 3rd and longs so I think its really complementary football in all three phases and thats a mark of a really good football team.\n",

I know we have a schedule for a couple years so well see what happens but I would love to play  I think Corvallis and Pullman are two amazing places and if you have an opportunity to play games there that is what college football is all about.

            "Answer 831:    I think theyre all a problem and I think we need to have a conference commissioner and I think football should be separate from the other sports.  Just the fact that our school is leaving to go to the Big Ten in football our softball team should be playing Arizona in softball.  Our basketball team should be playing Arizona in basketball.\n",

            "Answer 1018:    When I was dribbling at the end?  If they had got close I was going to call a timeout because Coach told me we had two timeouts so I was just waiting it out seeing if they was going to trap but I felt like we could get it up the court so I was trying to waste as much time as we could and get it to a good ball handler you see Reed make a good pass.\n",

But I give him two a half.  The third one youre coming out.  Youre not going nuts.  This isnt the andone tape.\n",

I cant believe  now heres the issue.  He wants to be the point guard.  But his dad is 69 and built like him probably bigger shoulders so hes probably still growing.  I doubt if youre going to be a point guard.\n",

            "Answer 1022:    Well I got in the huddle and I just said theres 11 seconds to go.  Do you want to foul when they get to half court?  Naturally they said no that were going to switch.  Then I saw Cadeau in the game and I told Reed when he crosses half court foul him so that it doesnt even go to Davis.\n",

Is that something youre going to try to get for J.T. and the whole line next year?\n",

            "Answer 1030:    Obviously holistically the beautiful part about football is its not subjective.  We watch the film its going to be very clear what happened and what we didnt execute.

The down side in the second half he was in situations where they knew he had to throw the ball.
