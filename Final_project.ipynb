How would you describe this group of guys to people that aren't familiar with the Pelicans in terms of how much fun you guys have and kind of the bond and some of the entertaining stuff that you do throughout the season?\n",
            "Answer 2:    Goofy.  We come to work we all have fun.  Off the court on the court we all have fun.  We're all around the same age.\n",

            "Answer 4:    For me I think my motivating factor is just seeing my teammates really getting ready for these games.  Like this is a different approach.  You see some of my teammates getting  some of them that don't get extra shots after the game they're really locked in and getting extra shots after shootaround or after practice.  It's just like a different feel.\n",

Have you been surprised how quickly it's picked up around the league and other guys around the league have been invested in it as fast as everybody has been?\n",
            "Answer 8:    I mean I'm not surprised because everybody loves competing for something especially with all the talent that's in the league.  You see how the Lakers came out last night and how Phoenix fought back in that second half last night.\n",

Compared to the atmosphere that you expect in November and December how much fun has it been to play in some of these InSeason Tournament games the game Monday in Sacramento but also the games in New Orleans and how much are you looking forward to tomorrow night's atmosphere?\n",
            "Answer 10:    It feels like March Madness a little bit.  Or like an AAU team traveling and being in the same spot in Vegas.\n",

            "Answer 11: CJ McCOLLUM   I was very confident.  I felt like we had a really good chance of taking advantage of the opportunity in front of us with the preparation with us having a more healthy roster.  And as a person with his own wine brand McCollum Heritage 91 it just made sense for me to travel with my own wine.  If you need some I have some in my suitcase.  I'll make sure you get some because you asked the question.  I have the pinot with me right now.  I have the chardonnay.  I have the blanc de blanc as well as the ros.  So I got you.  And if you want more you can purchase some at McCollumHeritage91.com.\n",

            "Answer 12: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah well unfortunately I wasn't able to play in the actual leadup of the tournament.  I was watching at home and then was able to come back and see the game against Denver.  But it's been a really cool experience for all of our guys to play in meaningful games with the stakes obviously the financial incentive.  The ability to be able to compete on a big stage where there's only InSeason Tournament games being played against quality playoff opponents.  It was fun to play on the road in Sacramento against a really good team who plays fast who executes who has playoff experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 13: Obviously in your role with the Players Association you're involved in conversations about events like this and plans for the league moving forward.  From your perspective how do you think this has played out overall and what are some things you'd like to see tweaked to improve it more next year?\n",
            "Answer 13: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah I think it's been a success.  I think if you look at the way it's been perceived you look at how the players have played the types of games we've gotten  we've had buzzer beaters we've had star power performing at a high level.\n",

            "Question 14: From your days of playing NBA Summer League here in Las Vegas can you talk a little bit about your relationship with this city and your thoughts of having these games played here in Las Vegas?\n",
            "Answer 14: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah I think it's been really cool.  As a kid you watch Vegas Summer League and you envision yourself being able to play out there after you're drafted. Having played in Summer League for a few years and then coming essentially every summer to watch games do some TV and things of that nature it's been a really cool transformation for myself.  I've never been to Vegas in December so to be able to see what the city is like in December has been cool.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 15: You've mentioned the financial incentive a couple of times.  Do you know what you would do with the prize money if you win it all?\n",
            "Answer 15: CJ McCOLLUM   I'd invest some of it and probably give some to some of the charities I'm a part of and associated with.  But I think the good news is that there's a lot of players on all of our teams  I think Dame talked about it  who aren't fortunate to make as much money as some of the guys that are high paid.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 16: I know you have two games left to win but if the Pelicans were to win the InSeason Tournament how would you want to see the organization celebrate that?  Would you want a ring?  Would you want a banner?  What do you think would be appropriate?\n",
            "Answer 16: CJ McCOLLUM   Geez well I hope we throw a really good party.  But also I think a banner I guess.  We'd have won three games in the Knockout Rounds?  I don't know that's a great question that I haven't really thought about.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 17: You mentioned about the InSeason Tournament potentially being in Miami.  Can you see it being in different locations?  And how scary is this team?  I feel like we haven't seen this team healthy but now that we're starting to how dangerous do you feel like this team is?\n",
            "Answer 17: CJ McCOLLUM   Yeah I'll answer the first question.  I think the great thing about our partnership with Adam and the NBA is that they're always receptive to feedback and willing to make changes or things that are helpful for the game and our players and our fans.  So I think anything is possible in terms of locations as we continue to progress.  Obviously Vegas has been great to us and we enjoy it. But I think anything can be reevaluated depending on feedback we receive from the collective group.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 18: How much do you want to beat Dame in the Finals?\n",
            "Answer 18: CJ McCOLLUM   That's my guy.  I'll see my guy tonight and give him some wine.  But I think it would be cool to make it to the Finals first and foremost.  We're competitors we're friends.  I think fans would probably enjoy it and it would be a really good matchup for both of our teams.  But I just want to win.  I really don't care who it's against personally.  I would definitely make him post my wine or something like that after we won.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 19: You and LeBron rookie years the same year.  How crazy is it to see him do this in year 21?\n",
            "Answer 19:    It's incredible what he's doing.  Right now I'm 42 so he can't be too far behind me.  To be playing at such a high level at  is this 22 years or 21 years?  Playing at such a high level 21 years in the NBA his impact on the game on the younger generation has been incredible and it's amazing to see.\n",

            "Answer 20:    I don't.  I don't remember too many details of our  you said my 10th game my rookie season?  No.  No I don't.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 21: What are your thoughts on the environment here playing these games in Las Vegas in this city in this environment?\n",
            "Answer 21:    The games they've been a lot of fun.  I think the NBA has done a great job of providing a platform that allows high competitive meaningful games during the regular season and all of our guys  I think all of us we didn't know what to expect to be honest with you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 22: Last time you were involved in fighting for a title was with the Suns in 2021.  What did you learn from that experience and what can you apply from that experience?\n",
            "Answer 22:    The biggest thing going through those type of experiences is the journey is what it takes to get there.  All of the film work the player development time the practice time the team dinners on the road working with the performance staff doing all the little things and building the relationships and camaraderie with your teammates coaches front office it makes you stronger.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 23: Now that you've been through the group stage an elimination game and gotten here what are some things you could see the league doing to improve this event for next year?\n",
            "Answer 23:    Well our mentality right now is we're relishing in the positives that they've already done.  Before we can even get to improvements we want to digest what we are experiencing.  It's hard to digest it right now because we're in it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 24: As a guy who's obviously been around the league for a long time it seems like this thing has picked up a lot of momentum within the league faster than maybe anybody would have guessed.  Has that been the case for you and why do you think that's been the case?\n",
            "Answer 24:    It's definitely been the case for myself and our team.  A lot of hard work goes into providing this type of platform and I'm grateful for the hearts and the minds that it takes to be willing to make some changes.  That's what it's about.  That's what the NBA is about and we're grateful to be a team that's a part of this.\n",

            "Question 25: I feel like you guys are a very scary team because you guys are just now starting to get healthy.  Trey Murphy is getting rolling Herb Jones is really getting rolling offensively too as well.  Two I wanted to ask about your team coming together and now being healthy.  I've been talking to a lot of coaches and they bring you up as a coach that draws up a lot of good sets circle pins.  A lot of people tell me to watch your sets that you run.  You being a former player where did you get that from in terms of being able to draw up good sets and people watching your work?\n",
            "Answer 25:    Yeah for sure.  To answer the first part of the question we're capable right now.  We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.  We know there's a ton of work that goes into being a really good team in the NBA and being consistent and winning consistently.  Those are the things that we're working on.\n",

            "Answer 26:    A lot of it has to do with the different characteristics of our players.  So we tailor most of our ATOs around who they are and how we can get them the best quality shot for sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 27: Do you think that the IST will become an accolade that helps define a player's personal success or a franchise when they start looking at it like this is what the franchise has accomplished over its years?\n",
            "Answer 27:    I think it's going to be added to what's already here.  Obviously we have AllStar Game AllNBA playoff experiences Finals.  I think this is going to be another component to what makes players great in the NBA.\n",

            "Answer 30:    Yeah smooth man.  I think we were able to get out here yesterday get a good practice day in.  Vegas is Vegas.  Obviously the bright lights.  I think it's going to be really cool for the exposure just for our organization more national exposure at that. Yeah I've got no complaints.  Be able to get in get the body acclimated a little bit and get ready to go tomorrow.\n",

            "Answer 31:    Yeah I think the way our culture is set up guys are always together.  I think that's a big part of the Association building that camaraderie with your team.  Guys were up and active ready to go this morning.  We got a good lift in yesterday.  Yeah it kind of does feel like Summer League just kind of the feel of everything just being together at all times.\n",

            "Answer 32:    Yeah somewhat.  It's still very early.  This is what it's good for right now being battle tested.  For guys like myself who's been to the Playoffs you know what that level that intensity what it feels like but for the guys that haven't you never know until they actually get there.  So when they have these reps this early in the season and exposure like this or longer days like that even like the longer media timeouts stuff you don't typically see it's really good for that.\n",

            "Question 33: Tyrese is the leader of this team one of the top scorers.  You are here maybe with a trophy on Saturday.  This year is the AllStar also in your city.  Do you think maybe this is his year the year of Tyrese Haliburton and maybe the year when he can turn into one of the big stars of the league?\n",
            "Answer 33:    Yeah it's a slippery slope with that.  I think Tyrese had his first AllStar berth last year and he got a taste of what that's like after the Team USA stuff this past summer.  I think for him everything is about winning.  I think he's made that kind of super clear with everything.  I respect that being really even keel.\n",

            "Question 34: I wanted to ask you how do you compare the atmosphere from the InSeason Tournament to the playoff atmosphere with the Pacers?  And then two you guys had some moments you and Tyrese in terms of chemistry.  Jrue kind of veers out on the pickandroll and then you wouldn't set the pick you would kind of veer out.  Just wanted to ask you about that.  Was that something you guys went over?  I think Tyrese did a doublecross out of it and then you wouldn't even set the screen you kind of knew that move was coming.  Did you talk about that before too as well?\n",

            "Answer 35:    It was unreal.  I personally hadn't seen Gainbridge rocking like that in the past three to four years since we've been to the actual playoff environment.  But what's that decibel thing called?  I'm sure that was off the charts man like jet enginetype stuff.  It was amazing in there.\n",

That's kind of a really big thing for me like starting to buy up land back home in Texas.  That's something other ventures and whatnot I'm starting to get into.\n",

For someone who's seen the organization go as much as it's gone through the highs and lows the ups and downs the rebuilds to where we are now it's a little bit of fruit of your labors.  It's fun stuff like I said.  The opportunity is something that is definitely a blessing.  I'm excited to just go out there and just get the opportunity to play little matinee action.\n",

What are some things you'd like to see tweaked to make it better next year?\n",

What's that been like to experience that this week?\n",

Like we talked about all year the better we play the more love we're going to get and you've got to take that in stride but understand that can be a poison to a sense at the same time.

            "Answer 44:    Yeah I'm curious to see what changes next year.  I would assume that the league would probably like more teams to be in Vegas.  But at the same time just to avoid the tiebreaker kind of mess that was going on.  Everybody was like if who wins what happens.  I think maybe playing a couple more games maybe outside of your group maybe in the other conference something like that. Just playing more games to have more different scenarios with tiebreakers and make it make a little more sense.  I'm curious to see what it looks like next year for sure.\n",

I think we all are NBA fans first and foremost so we've all seen it watched it watched our favorite players do it so to be a part of it is pretty cool.  To get a taste to be playing on national TV and stuff like that is cool.  You just want to keep doing it and you've got to win to do that at the end of the day.\n",

A lot of people in the league feel like this is probably where the league would move to if expansion happened or anything like that.  I think everybody would love that because who doesn't love Vegas.  Summer League is always fun for everybody.

And then you're shooting 40 percent from threepoint range in college and also now do you still have that in the back of your mind going out there playing with a crazy chip on your shoulder?\n",
            "Answer 47:    Yeah for sure.  I think all the greats do.  They find the things that give them a little bit of an edge so I'm just relishing in that moment and relishing that I was a nostar recruit in high school.

            "Answer 48:    I guess.  I got eliminated in the first round so not like I can really relate to the NCAA Tournament.  But I think the early start that plays a little bit of a part to it.

It does seem like across the league interest was high on the court with the players.  Is the motivation to win something that's new?  Is it the prize money?  You've talked at length about how you haven't won anything in a long time.  I'm curious what you think the motivation leaguewide is for this tournament.\n",
            "Answer 49:    I look at it as motivation to win.  The motivation is we play in the best league in the world with a bunch of the greatest competitors in the world.  I don't know if people really care what the prize is to be honest with you.  You just want to win because you want to say that you did and others didn't and I think that matters.\n",

            "Answer 50:    Yeah he's Damian Lillard.  He's one of the greatest point guards to ever play this game.  Obviously we know what he brings to the table with his shooting ability.  It's been well documented the pickandroll between him and Giannis or with Brook as well with Giannis on the back side.  We've just got to be prepared for that and I think we'll be ready for that.\n",

            "Answer 51:    Yeah I think that's just part of what they've built over there.  That's the reason they won a championship is because you've got a guy like Giannis who can get downhill put so much pressure on the rim and you surround him with shooters all over the floor that poses a really difficult threat when defending them.\n",

            "Answer 53:    Yeah predictably it's very impressive what they've done here.  The logistics the separate kind of preparation area all that stuff really impressive how they did that.  They've got a whole banner thing the size of one of the sides of the building that has all four teams printed on it.  They must have done that 13 hours ago or something unless they just printed up a bunch of different combinations.  But that's impressive.\n",

            "Answer 55:    Yeah you know we trust our players.  Our guys even though we're a young team they understand the magnitude of the opportunity.  I expect most of them tonight to do just a nice dinner and get off their feet.\n",

Talk a little bit about that.\n",
            "Answer 57:    Yeah when you're a young player in this league and you're trying to move your team up the ladder these kinds of meaningful games are extremely important because what young teams find out eventually when they get into a playoff environment is that it's only about this possession the next possession what's going on whistle to whistle.

            "Answer 59:    Well it's four teams that are playing for the Cup so I'm not trying to get too much into acronyms or metaphors or anything like that. But this is the first InSeason Tournament it's the first NBA Cup.  The level of interest has been phenomenally high.  We're coming in here with guns blazing.  That's how we've got to play.

In terms of emptying the tank with LeBron in a single elimination game like this is this playoff level willingness?  Is it regular season level willingness or is it somewhere in between how hard you're willing to do with your top players?\n",
            "Answer 60:    You know I think it's somewhere in between for sure.  Again I think it's fun too to have  it wasn't fun being in the moment but it's intense highly intense in the moment but in terms of trying to manage your star players and be efficient with their workload  it's two things.  If they're managing anything physically that's not really preventing them from playing but also something you need to be on the lookout for coupled with their performance.  It's easy to say oh just play them this many amount of minutes but if they're out there tearing it up it's tough.  You don't want to take them out neither do they want to come out.\n",

            "Answer 61:    Yeah every game we play we have our designated sections on both sides of the ball our themes that we keep in a database whenever we need to pull something out and illustrate something to the team or think about a different coverage or a different play call.  We already have that in our database.\n",

They're a wellbalanced team in my opinion and they've dealt with some injury issues and they seem to be coming back whole.  Larry Nance is not out there right now but some of their other guys Trey Murphy is back Alvarado CJ obviously but they're a wellbalanced team.  They reflect their coach just hardnosed and just go about his business and doesn't try to draw too much crazy attention to himself and just go out there and make plays.\n",

How much do you feel like this tournament has forced teams to be ready from the getgo because at the end of the tournament there's a big incentive whether the NBA Cup or the monetary incentive?\n",
            "Answer 63:    Really it's a little precursor I think for anybody that hasn't had the opportunity to participate in it and those who have the competitive spirit the intensity is very reflective of the playoffs.  When you think about it I think some of the games I've watched from around the league how intense they are going down to the wire I think again you have a trophy that you can win you have a big purse that you can win.  You've really got to be on your game and it's similar  it's funny it's a split between the NBA and the NCAA with the tournament style setup.\n",

            "Answer 64:    I mean I don't think about all that stuff really to be honest man.  I just think we try to take care of what's in front of us.  Right now it's a nongame day so recovery and film study was the priority.  Tomorrow the game will obviously be the priority.  We're just trying to  we're getting healthy bodies back so we're just trying to build continuity and build the best possible rhythm and not skip any steps.  We don't fast forward to the playoffs anything like that.  We try to extract as much as we can out of each and every day whether it's a nongame day or a game day we try to get better at something so we stay in the moment.\n",

Do you think that would potentially be a good idea also?\n",
            "Answer 67:    Possibly.  Possibly that's something definitely that should be looked at.  Maybe it's some type of draft competition as well as the purse I don't know something like that.  I think it would be cool.\n",

We talk a lot about AD but the perimeter defense Max Vando Cam Taurean their ability and being able to see that group finally because I know a lot of guys have been hurt what are some things you're starting to see with this team in terms of how good you guys have been defensively?  They did a great job on Book did a great job on KD.  Give me your thoughts on how good this group can be defensively.\n",

            "Answer 69:    I just think the ability to not have to scheme.  I mean obviously you're going to have a counter or you're going to mix up pitches whatever metaphor you want to use but to be able to go into a game and start out a game and not have to doubleteam unless you choose to and our doubleteams have been really highquality been very beneficial to our defense but that says if you're able to go into a game and able to play people straight up that creates balance on the defensive end of the floor for your team.

When we've had games on Tuesdays and Fridays we've played them.  You kind of know it's a tournament game.

But it's really well set up for my game and most of the guys out here.  Bombing driver will be  if you've got it a strength something to take advantage of.  It seems like a real ball striker's course.  Iron play is going to be a premium.  If you can hit it close enough the greens are rolling pure so you can go low.\n",

            "Answer 128:    In our transition from the Pac12 to the Big 12 it's really important for us to start making more of a presence in Texas.  If you look at our team we have five players on our roster from Texas.  We know that as the years progress starting next year when we'll be playing in the Big 12 we're going to have to add more players from Texas into our program.  We'll have more of a recruiting opportunity because of the fact that we'll be playing in the state against TCU and Baylor and Houston and Texas Tech.\n",

They play with great confidence.  They know what they're doing.  They're very wellcoached fundamentally sound.  You're going to have to earn everything that you get.\n",

Does that make things difficult in terms of picking up where you left off from the gains you made defensively this year especially?\n",
            "Answer 131:    I don't know if it makes things difficult.  I think it gives guys opportunity.  This is college football.  You can't keep guys forever.\n",

            "Answer 136:    The only thing I would say it didn't have anything to do with Jackson.  I think Dillon had every intention to go to the NFL.  In his mind this was going to be his last season.  He's going to have a great year put himself in a position to go chase his dreams in the NFL.

            "Answer 140:    Well Andrew Nembhard gave us a big lift in the third quarter when we were reeling.  Their zone was a problem.  We just didn't get a very good rhythm against it right away.  He helped us get the ball in the basket three or four straight times.\n",

Was there a moment when you saw that in this group?\n",
            "Answer 143:    Well with guys like Tyrese  Myles Turner has been around nine years but he's still 27 years old.  He's still a young player.  They both have different experience.  Myles was here when some of the veteran teams were in the Playoffs.  He got a taste of it.  He's really longed for this kind of feeling this kind of meaningful games.

The month seven weeks that he's put together so far in this season people are talking about him for MVP and rightly so.  AllStar is in Indy this year so we're super excited about that and we feel obviously that he'll represent us there.\n",

            "Answer 146:    I think the turnover that I had I came off the pickandroll and I tried to it was the same pocket pass that I had been throwing.  Myles he just barely tipped it.  He got a hand on it.  It's a play that happens sometimes.  That ball gets through Brook is going for a dunk you know what I mean.\n",

            "Answer 147:    It wasn't really a moment for communication.  They had just scored and we had just inbounded the ball and brought it up.  It wasn't really much.  It was  I was just opposite him and you know it wasn't like we drew up the play were we talked about the play or nothing.\n",

            "Answer 148:    I think it was pretty cool to be a part of just you know it's an allornothing situation but it's not the end of the season so it's not quite like the playoffs but it's something to get up for.  It's some new excitement and you know it's a surprise in the end that everybody is kind of hunting for and then you look at the trip to Vegas and they roll out the red carpet.

            "Answer 149:    I think it's a little bit of both.  You know obviously we are not going to make it bigger than what it is because it's December.  I think it's one of those moments where it's not like everything because we're going to continue to play but we were playing to stay here you know for the game Saturday.  You know you want an opportunity to win the prize and you want that for your younger teammates you want to extend your week here and just continue to be part of the event.  So when something is on the line like that the stakes are higher and it's a good moment to test yourself and see who you are when those moments come and how you're going to respond.\n",

            "Answer 150:    I learned as a kid when you dish it out you've got to be willing to take it.  For as many times as I've done it to people I can't be upset when somebody else does it you know what I mean.

            "Answer 151:    Yeah we got to execute better down the stretch.  I've got to do a better job of getting them into some certain sets down you know late game.  But we put ourselves in a position you know the first half was rocky.  We made some good adjustments but we've got to close out in the fourth quarter which we've done very well.  We just couldn't pull it off tonight.\n",

            "Answer 152:    Yeah listen you give up 15 Oboards with 23 secondchance points it's going to be tough to beat anybody I think that's what the game was.  We've got to do better.  We've got to try and find a body.  You know they are crashing and I thought we did a good job in the second half taking the threes out and I think that was critical.  But we've got to limit them to one shot.  You know you cut that in half and it's probably a different outcome.\n",

            "Answer 153:    Well you know just kind of help us keep the ball front of us.  You know Haliburton he's  you know he's exceptional in pickandrolls so we were just trying to switch up our coverages a little bit.  I thought you know the zone got us back in and I think if we would have rebounded a little bit better probably a different outcome.  They are a good team very wellcoached team.  They played with exceptional energy and this is also an opportunity for us to learn and grow from and we'll be better.  You know we'll be better.\n",

You know media the excitement around it it's been great and I think we handled it well.  Not the outcome that we wanted but you could learn from these  from these games and what we need to do to get better and that's what it's about.

            "Answer 155:    There's just no way around it.  Just got to sprint back on a range of shots and you've got to make great decisions you're either crashing oboards or you've got to sprint.  I thought a couple times we let them get behind us even off made baskets and I think one off a free throw if I'm not mistaken.  Those you've got to take those off the board.  You can't give this team those type of points.  You've got to make them earn it.  And I thought you know for the most part in the second half we started to make them earn it a little bit more but you can't allow them to get those easy ones in transition.\n",

I think it's going to do wonders for our team you know you always win  you always learn in wins and you learn in losses and there's things because we feel like you know we could have executed a little bit better especially down the stretch but again we watch film we learn from it I learn from it and then you just keep moving forward.\n",

Any time there's an opportunity to compete especially in this environment we definitely wanted to be a part of it.  So there's a lot of good in the InSeason Tournament.  I thought it was fantastic.

            "Answer 171:    It feels damn good.  I'm not going to lie.  It's been a long time coming because I know what this organization is capable of and just to have Indy to have their guy and just have a great bench and great depth I couldn't be happier.\n",

Also they got 43 in the third and you guys hold them to 25 in the fourth.  What did you do to bunker down defensively after what went wrong in the third?\n",
            "Answer 172:    I think a lot of guys just made some shots.  I think we got Bruce in the middle.  You guys know for the last few years his bread and butter has been his twofoot floater and he was able to get to that.  Drew was really big in that third quarter making some really tough shots in the midrange and stuff like that.  This guy dominated the paint for us offensively.\n",

            "Answer 174:    I know for me personally it's just kind of cool to have Indiana Pacers jersey on and come out here and see all the Pacers jerseys on the side.  You have your bigmarket teams and whenever they come to our arena you see a whole bunch of green or a bunch of purple or a bunch of different away fans that travel.  But to see them waking up I guess the rest of the nation now we have our fans traveling.  We're genuinely excited about us at a neutral site like this.  I thought it was incredible.  The energy in Gainbridge before we left for that Boston game that's the best I've seen it the past three to four years ever since the last time we were in the Playoffs.\n",

            "Answer 177:    Feels good.  You know it feels good.  I think it gives meaning to the game.  Makes the game more competitive.  It's always good to play for another trophy during the season.  Pretty much that's it.  Obviously now overseas they do it.  I know the G League does it.  It was kind of strange when I came around here 10 years ago that the NBA wasn't doing that.  It was only the Championship.  But I think it just brings a lot of meaning to the games and if you play a game like this at 200 p.m. 200 p.m here 400 p.m. in Milwaukee 1000 p.m. in Greece people stay up and watch the game.  It was fun.  Fun experience.  Happy that we were able to make Vegas in the first year it happened.  Obviously we didn't go to the Final game but at the end of the day you know you live you learn.

            "Answer 179:    The team.  We have to be more organized.  We have to know what we are trying to get down the stretch.  You know at the end of the day like down the stretch it's about effort man.  It's about effort and attitude you have to go out there and take it.  I feel like the Indiana team that's what they did.  They crashed the board got defensive rebounds.  You know they got to their spots.  They played great defense.  You know got deflections.  Like at the end of the day like nothing is going to be given to you in life.  Nothing is going to be given to you in an NBA game and we cannot just expect that to be we run a play and because we run the play we are going to score a bucket.  Like you've got to execute.  You've got to cut hard screen harder get open drive the ball you know make something happen.\n",

Was it a function of the zone and maybe losing sense of where they were or what did you  how did you see them be able to kind of take advantage of that in the second half?\n",
            "Answer 180:    Played harder than us.  Simple as that.  Obviously playing the zone you're not guarding you're just guarding like an area.  Try to keep  have a guy in front of you.  And sometimes when the ball goes up obviously if you try to find a body to get back you know to kind of crack a body but at the end of the day I don't even think that was the case.  I think they just played harder than us and we've just got to accept it.\n",

What was some of the talk in reference to from player to player and how you guys felt about this type of structure?\n",
            "Answer 182:    I don't say much in the locker room.  I just keep it to myself.  Stay locked in.  Focus on my routine.  Take care of my body and prepare for the game.\n",

            "Answer 185:    Yeah I'll say obviously the talent level that we have is incredible.  But we have to be more organized.  We have to be more organized.  I feel like sometimes we're not organized at all.  We don't know what we try to get from our offense or sometimes defensively we're not sprinting back.  We don't  we create a lot of  shoot a lot of early threes. At the end of the day you have to protect the ball.  You have to know where the ball is.  We had a lot of situations today that they got a lot of dunks open threes early threes.  We have to be better.  And the other thing is that obviously our chemistry gamebygame going to keep on getting closer.  Again because we have new players on the team Malik and Dame which we've played a lot of years in the previous years with the same basically core and now it's different.  We have to know what their weaknesses are what their strengths are where they want the ball what spots on the floor they want the ball and the biggest thing I believe is that we got to  we've got to want it.  You know nobody is going to give you nothing.\n",

He did the Dame Time celebration and they were really excited to beat you guys.  Do you sense that because you've been at the top of the East for so long that a team like Indiana is using you guys as a measuring stick and is coming for you guys?\n",
            "Answer 187:    Oh for sure not just Indiana.  Everybody is coming for us.  At the end of the day if I saw Dame and Giannis and Brook and Khris on the other team I'm coming for them too you know like at the end of the day you want to aim and kind of play your best against the best.\n",

            "Question 188: What was the message to the team after a tough loss that really got away from you guys like that?\n",
            "Answer 188:    Our messages was simple it took a lot to get to this point.  We gave them a ton of credit and let them know that that does not go unnoticed the games that we had to win the tough game in Sacramento.  But tonight was a total let down.  We were all disappointed in our competitive spirit against the Lakers.  You got to give them credit they came out and they dominated.\n",

            "Answer 189:    Like I said just a lack of competitive spirit from our group.  That's not indicative of who we've been and who we are but tonight we took a step in the wrong direction.  I'm not going to take anything away from the Lakers they came out and they dominated wire to wire.  I thought the first quarter was solid and then after that they took it up another level and we didn't match that at all.\n",

            "Question 190: What did you see in the third quarter specifically?\n",
            "Answer 190:    We got to continue to trust pretty much.  When the game gets hard when teams pick up their physicality you have to execute at an even higher level.  We started to go away from that on both ends of the floor and that becomes deflating when we try to do it by ourselves.\n",

            "Question 191: I think most of the top decision makers with this team understand that to really get to the level that the Lakers are at right now you're going to have to follow Zion's lead.  What kind of extra levers can you pull here to put him in better positions to be that true No. 1 kind of like life blood of a winning postseason team here?\n",
            "Answer 191:    Yeah experience is key for us right now.  We haven't had the experiences that the Lakers have.  They know what it takes to win games like that.  They know what it takes to be on the big stage and have big moments.  For some of our guys this is their first time since college being in elimination games.\n",

            "Answer 192:    Yeah tonight wasn't our night obviously offensively defensively.  I've said it before the Lakers they have that experience.  You saw LeBron on full display.  He understands these moments.  We got a young team that will eventually get there but tonight was not our night we're all disappointed in it and we'll go home we'll regroup and continue to improve from here.\n",

            "Answer 193:    Well he has to get the ball in different ways number one transition.  So rebound the ball you can push before their defense is set that's a way that we can attack.  Sometimes in pickandrolls being able to set the screen dive now you catch it on the move now it kind of frees him up to be able to score a little bit more in our half court.\n",

            "Answer 194:    You know me I'm a simple guy so I just think to one word.  Extraordinary.  Otherworldly.  That's two I know.  A oneofone.  That's a phrase.  That's not a word.\n",

            "Answer 195:    I just think that we have a lot of bodies.  A lot of long athletic wings and players where we can switch randomly.  We can switch deliberately.  AD is a huge huge factor.  Backing up and anchoring the back line of our defense it allows Bron and Cam and Taurean and Rui everybody Austin DLo everybody Max to just play free and be aggressive. The biggest thing we talk about is again playing with multiple efforts trying to have multiple efforts.  Strategies defensively they are not always going to be perfect.  So you can't get discouraged.  You just have to play with energy.  Energy most times most instances they cover up the technical mistakes. So we have a lot of that.\n",

I wonder if you can remember the first conversations you had with maybe your leaders of the team Anthony and LeBron about what we want to do as a group in this thing how we want to approach it.  Was there any kind of galvanizing conversations where you all decided like hey this is something we really want to prioritize and go for?\n",
            "Answer 197:    I can't really pinpoint.  I don't know if there was a moment or a conversations in particular.  I just know we came into this year wanting to build continuity and cohesiveness as quickly as possible.\n",

            "Answer 198:    I mean we got guys that are hawks and he's right back there along with AD communicating coverages and yelling out switches.  He switched a couple times.  We had a random blitz in there.  They hurt us early in the first quarter with rebounds and we were turning the ball over a little bit.  We were able to clean that up in the second quarter.\n",

            "Answer 199:    No thoughts.  Definitely no recipe.  I would just say it's refreshing to see a young player of his magnitude.  He's had a hell of a year past 12 months being named an AllStar being selected to the USA team.  He's just out there hooping.  I watched a little bit of that game today.

            "Answer 200:    I mean the thing I'm starting to see is when we lock in and everybody is pulling the rope in the same direction and everybody is focused on the objectives within the game plan and the strategy that we are using to attack these teams on both sides of the ball and when we sacrifice one another we are damn near unstoppable.\n",

You're starting to get a glimpse of maybe what the next four or five months could look like for this team?\n",

            "Answer 204:    I don't know.  I mean that's to be seen.  I think we are starting to get a feel for who we need to become as a team in order for us to win basketball games and be consistent.  We know that defensively we are starting to really really tap into that like okay we got to defend every single night.  And when we defend we are going to give ourselves a chance to win every night.  I think when you got guys on a string you've got guys communicating defensively you might have a breakdown here but then you've got one of your teammates on the back line that is picking up for you it brings a lot of good mojo to the team.\n",

            "Answer 216:    Similar.  I wouldn't say it's exactly the same but it's definitely similar.  They try to build up the atmosphere for that and try to make it feel like a Playoff game.  I wouldn't necessarily say it is but it's very close to it.\n",

            "Answer 217:    Yeah I mean any time your best player sacrifices his body takes three charges in the first half especially with Zion coming down the paint it sets a tone.  That shows to everybody else how locked in he is to win this and how locked in he is every game.\n",

And like I said when one of your best players your best player acts like that it trickles down to everybody else and you always have a good vibe going around the locker room.\n",

            "Answer 220:    Just the energy.  They play with a lot of pace.  Tyrese does a hell of a job leading their whole team.  The way they play offensively super fast a lot of threes.  But just the pace that they play with we are going to have to be on high alert.\n",

You probably aren't surprised by how well he's playing but I guess did you see what he's been able to do in this NBA season?  Did you see that coming last summer?\n",
            "Answer 221:    Yeah I told DLo before the season started that if they are competing in the East then I think he has a chance to win an MVP at some point just because of the way he plays and the unselfishness that he plays with.\n",

I know you came from USA and probably didn't have the start that you wanted but back to the efficiency numbers that you are accustomed to.  How has it been feeling for you the last couple times?\n",
            "Answer 222:    Any time you make shots it feels great.  But there's a lot more to basketball than that.  I'm sure you all know that.  Like you said I had not shot the ball well the first part of the year for the most part but like I said there's a lot more to the game than percentages and stats.  For me it's just play the game the right way. But obviously it feels good when you see shots go in.\n",

            "Question 230: Willie said that LeBron knows how to take advantage of these moments and he's someone that you were obviously compared to a lot coming into the league. Do you still kind of look at him and see how he attacks moments like this for kind of like an example of how to put a franchise on your shoulders?  Is that something that you're evaluating?\n",
            "Answer 230:    Absolutely.  Like I said I got to be more aggressive.  He was aggressive.  His teammates saw that and the energy carried over.  So I got to just be more aggressive and get off to better starts in games.\n",

I have a problem where I literally just try to hunt the best shot possible every time but my teammates they expect more from me I expect more from myself and I got to just trust my game.  I just got to be more aggressive.  I think if I'm more aggressive then that energy will definitely carry over.\n",

            "Answer 232: D'ANGELO RUSSELL   Yeah honestly exactly that.  It's impressive to watch him just turn it to another gear in these big games.  Honestly he can shoot it better.  He's faster.  He's more athletic.  He's not getting tired.  I just don't understand.  But it's impressive to watch from the outside looking in.\n",

Obviously the evolution of the game has forced a lot of money to be at stake so you know getting an opportunity to pay for your summer in winnings pay for your AllStar break so you could even pay for the next two summers with this amount of money that's at stake.\n",

            "Answer 236: D'ANGELO RUSSELL   I think it's huge.  I think it's huge.  Like Bron said for Adam to be able to put the situation in the season like that and not lose a step is good for the game.  And obviously any city that's playing in PlayIn games you can be in Detroit or wherever those fans are going to come out.  So I think it's huge for the game.  It's huge for the fans in those cities that may not ever get a playoff  may not ever be able to see the playoffs so I think it's huge.\n",

            "Answer 237: D'ANGELO RUSSELL   I think it's a big deal just to be part of the legacy.  I think that would make my legacy a little underrated for the outside looking in.  But for my family my fans my friends they know what I've been through here and they know who I've crossed paths with and to be able to stand next to LeBron and AD and guys like that and win a championship I don't know if it will go unnoticed to a lot of people but for me it will be a huge deal.

But you can't have that mindset in professional golf if you want to be at the pinnacle.  You've got to think about winning each round.

The Tyrese story to me the neat part is it's introducing him to the mainstream public the matchup with LeBron you've got old and new which is pretty cool.  You've got Giannis on the court yesterday Zion.  Generally speaking with an event like this that showcases the talent when you kind of read this room in 2023 having seen what you've seen where do you see the talent level?\n",

Rightfully so that's a side of the floor that we have to get a lot better at.  I think that our focus has grown so much throughout this tournament.  I think that defense is an effort thing.  You can draw up all the schematics in the world you can go out there and say we're going to do this we're going to do this pickandroll coverage.  It's a mindset thing.

The first part of your question like any kid born in 2000 LeBron was my favorite player growing up and it's hard for him not to be for a lot of us.

Why do you feel like people can't get to that move because you get to the paint all the time with that?  Then also with your shooting form you do a lot of rapid fire where you get your shot off super fast.  Do people try to tweak your shot?

I think as a young group and as somebody who's never made the Playoffs I've always viewed the NBA as looking so far ahead.  Like if we can go 10 and 5 in our next 15 whatever I feel like that's a naØve way to look at it and it's a young view of it.

They score a lot of points and are very capable of going on quick runs just with the way they shoot the ball and the way they play.  Being able to transition or not  honestly they kind of make it all transition even if you make a shot they get it out of the net real quick.

He doesn't really turn the ball over.  He instills confidence in you.  Anytime he swings the ball and you're open he wants you to shoot it.

The 2020 game when we played at Michie Stadium they had a 1st and goal at the 2 or the 1yard line or something.  We had four plays in a row and we stopped them.  I don't know if it'll live forever.

One thing about this game that's different than anybody else playing a college football game is there aren't any transfers out there.  There's not one.  No transfers.  Nobody that was playing on their team nobody that was playing on our team played at another college before they came here.  Our guys grow up in our program.  They come in as freshmen we develop them they grow up through the program they play together sophomores juniors and take the field for the last time tonight as seniors.  It's pretty special.

They were still getting their call and Tyson did a good job of not drawing too much attention to himself.

            "Answer 411:    It was incredible.  They had been working their tail off all season all four years for some of those guys and they were making big holes.  They were confident in the game plan as well and it's pretty cool seeing a freshman center lead the way behind guys like Connor Finucane who played a lot of ball Jackson Filipowicz and they were moving them back and allowing Kanye and myself and all the other running backs to get some big runs.  To be able to run for over 200 on Navy is no small feat because they have a great run defense.  It's really cool that we ran the ball so successfully today.\n",

            "Answer 415:    I did.  Talking to past quarterbacks who played ArmyNavy game they told me just once you get out there take it all in and getting to play at a place like Gillette with so much rich history with a quarterback like Tom Brady I was looking around and seeing all the greatness that had played there.  This was an awesome experience for us to play here in Boston.  Yeah it was incredible.\n",

After the defense made that stop there was three seconds on the clock and they just told me to run around and when they got close or when the clock hit zero to run out the back of the end zone to secure the win.

Saw it they did it twice and great defense and makes your job a lot easier on the offensive side.

In what ways did you do that and how did you embrace the environment as opposed to just pushing forward?\n",

Put aside the whole concept of the tournament but a lot of people thought that the money would not make a difference to the players.  I would only say it was nice to see that dynamic on a team where you have obviously a significant differential in some cases in terms of what some of the stars are making and some of the other players and it was nice to hear the stars saying still a lot of money for anyone but it's a lot more money proportionately for some of my teammates and the notion that I'm doing it for them is a nice concept in a team sport.

As I said it's very special to represent such a big brand like that.  I think small kids that don't really follow a lot in motorsport they know what DHL is.

How do you feel about this latest news the introduction the hybrids is being pushed further down the road?\n",

That's our commitment around sustainability.  As well we're partnered with Kalitta Motorsports.  We're in Moto GP.  We're in WEC's sponsorships.  We're pretty much covering all the leagues.

Before we joined the call I was telling Alex that we want to leverage the opportunity when he is in Spain to meet with our employees our customers in Spain.  Actually in Barcelona to be exact.

It's going to be a challenge.  It's going to be awesome.  You better be a competitive junkie if you get in here.  I'm glad I don't have to worry about that right now.\n",

            "Answer 525:    It's great to train against.  It's a great experience.  It's fun to see what another team sees from that perspective.  Not only is our front court tall and great blockers with a lot of speed but our back court also does a lot of work back there that doesn't get as much recognition but I think deserves it.\n",

            "Answer 526:    To be in the presence of pirates is pretty cool.  The club kids I mean that was awesome.  I think anytime that you can get people to dream big things is  to walk off the plane and see a bunch of younger players that were there  and I'm sure these guys were thinking about being their age and what that could be like sitting outside of a plane and watching people you look up to that are playing the game at the highest level coming down and having that moment.

            "Answer 530:    I would say you recognize how great of players they are.  Like Kelly mentioned before their roster from top to bottom are a bunch of competitors.  And so what that means for us is just there's no point in time when you can let up.

            "Answer 531:    I mean it means everything.  Looking back at the summer I can't fathom how that was all able to play out up until now.

How does that affect what you guys do?  I assume you've watched some video at this point.\n",

How do you prepare for fast offenses?  How do you adjust once you get into it?  It's first set now you're seeing this offense this fast offense for the first time.  How are those adjustments made and how are the preparations made?\n",
            "Answer 533:    Oregon was grease lightning.  I don't think I've seen anything that speed.  I don't think I've seen a setter like Pukis be able to  the courage that she displayed was really impressive and stretched us out in a lot of different ways.\n",

            "Answer 534:    I think for me it's just going to be like a whole lot of joy.  This is something you dream about especially like maybe since I was 11 years old committed.  But really it's like this is the dream.  You're a young girl playing club and this is the stage you want to get to.  So it's not backing down from the moment just really appreciating it taking it all in not trying to block anything out.  I think we've had a lot of examples of that this year playing in the Pfizer center playing at home playing on the road with soldout crowds just a lot of that.\n",

That is crazy.  I don't know if  I don't know if I've seen that.  They're almost better passing it poorly then getting it to her than staying in the system and getting it to her.\n",

I think elite players want to be a part of and do epic things and that's something that I think all four programs probably sell and we want to be recruiting.

            "Answer 538:    I think it's awesome.  I think the big block  I've hit against that every day in practice.  It is a little demoralizing to get absolutely roofed by Anna or Carter.  It's really exciting to see that in a game and know that they're on your team.\n",

Does it feel like this team is just peaking at exactly the right time for you guys?  Do you sense that?\n",
            "Answer 711:    Absolutely.  I think we expected it.  We've put in so much work and we've trained so hard.  It hasn't come easy and there's been challenges and up and downs.

You almost got knocked out in the region semifinals and here you are playing for a National Championship.  Can you put your finger on what quality this team has that's allowed you to get to this point?\n",
            "Answer 712:    It was a really rough start.  Just a lot of things weren't working a lot of pieces weren't together.  A lot of pieces we weren't able to train with and get together.  We had some illness.  We had some injuries.  So it was hard to get any kind of rhythm.\n",

            "Answer 715:    Yeah I mean it's natural.  When you have so many times that you've played a team in the championship for the Final Four that even existed way before I was and I've been here for 23 years.

I felt like I made some  I was able to knock a lot of the rust off there at Hero and felt  my hands felt better with control hitting shots and especially today with the wind blowing as hard as it was I was able to hit flighted shots nicely which was not quite on par or as sharp as I was as I wanted to be at Hero.\n",

Has that been a learning experience for you as well to kind of know when to let him kind of feel his way through life?\n",
            "Answer 730:    No I let him go.  And you know I provide guardrails for him and things that I would like to see him learn and address but also then again I'm trying to provide as much space as I can for him.

We were just transitioning out of Persimmon so it's a different era but also the different golf ball too.  We were able to do so much more with the golf ball.

            "Answer 737:    Well I think one of the things that we both do we don't realize we have that tick is our shirt tuck right.  And we both have allergies so we're always scratching our noise.  Those are ticks that we both have.\n",

Is there anything you're doing differently like in your approach to the course for the tournament?  Is there any holes that you thought maybe it should be Charlie teeing off?\n",
            "Answer 738:    Well that's one thing we were trying to figure out today and we were talking about going into this week.  Because he's playing a tee further back this year and the forecast the way it is whether or not he should hit first or I should hit first and put my little cut in play and let him be able to take a rip at it.\n",

As I said I like to feel and where I like  where I go off.  And today we were talking about some of my strokes and I then put a shaft down every now and again what I like to see and what I like to feel.  And audibly.  We talked through it together.

Winning majors is unbelievable and how he's won his majors but seeing how much he cares about Charlie and having Sam out here and him doing that together with Charlie and as he's watched him grow up it would be a very very different kind of win that doesn't maybe come with the record books and history and whatnot.\n",

I truly think it's one of those things especially when we won we started the second day a little bit back but like you're having a lot of fun when you're out there.

I understand I get updated maybe from time to time but I am  especially last year at the end I have bigger and better things to worry about to be selfish and honest.  My golf is  I shouldn't say more important because the future of the PGA TOUR is more important but selfishly for me my golf is.

We're seeing that trajectory like I said based off this last season in 2023 for the team.  Then me going into my sophomore year.  Historically my sophomore seasons have been quite a bit better than my rookie years for whatever reason.  I like to say I don't have the sophomore slump which is kind of nice.

            "Answer 808:    I definitely think the game is a lot faster.  That wasn't the biggest adjustment.

We took our guys that were on staff and basically promoted them for the week and a couple guys  it started actually the week before because we had to put guys on the road because we were down coaches on the road.

They play downhill football.  They're usually not behind in the chains.  They're not in a lot of 3rd and longs a lot of 2nd and longs.  They create a lot of 2nd and longs and they create a lot of 3rd and longs so I think it's really complementary football in all three phases and that's a mark of a really good football team.\n",

I know we have a schedule for a couple years so we'll see what happens but I would love to play  I think Corvallis and Pullman are two amazing places and if you have an opportunity to play games there that is what college football is all about.

            "Answer 831:    I think they're all a problem and I think we need to have a conference commissioner and I think football should be separate from the other sports.

If they had got close I was going to call a timeout because Coach told me we had two timeouts so I was just waiting it out seeing if they was going to trap but I felt like we could get it up the court so I was trying to waste as much time as we could and get it to a good ball handler you see Reed make a good pass.\n",

            "Answer 1031:    Obviously with the bowl game and a bowl game  we played our championship game two weeks ago  there's moving parts on both sides in terms of the roster.  We watched the game film we had and who was going to be starting quarterback who wasn't.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1032: Three of those drives you got in the red zone ended in field goals.  How badly did you want those to turn into touchdowns and how did that kind of change the game?\n",
            "Answer 1032:    Absolutely.  Football how you execute in the red zone is everything.  Not field goals scoring touchdowns.  Defensively it's all about holding an offense to 3 or nothing.  We talk about it defensively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1033: Andrew 336 yards they had in the second half.  Once Garbers came in how did that kind of change the game?\n",
            "Answer 1033:    He was just making good throws.  We have to do our job every play and we had a good plan going in but at the end day we have to make tackles and play as a team and those plays wouldn't go the way they did if we do that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1034: CJ was in a tough spot today.  What did you see from him and the inability to get the ball moving down the field in the passing game?  In the second half how did that make things tougher in the offense?\n",
            "Answer 1034:    Proud of CJ.  It was a tough situations to step into.  He didn't blink didn't hesitate.  The down side in the second half he was in situations where they knew he had to throw the ball.  Thirdand12 is not ideal for any quarterback I don't care who you are but especially a true freshman making his first start.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1035: Him aside do you need to add to that position to the portal before the next season?\n",
            "Answer 1035:    We're looking across the board.  My number one goal is taking care of our players.  We've got a young team.  We've got a great team great kids great young men that are going to be world changers.  We're going to keep them in Boise Idaho.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1036: You had many ups and downs this season.  What's your favorite part of the journey and also going forward?\n",
            "Answer 1036:    Definitely my favorite part of the journey is just with these young men.  They impact my life every day  Andrew George just to name two.  They changed my life.  And they impact me.  Seeing them come to work every day seeing them go through the downs where everybody counted us out they didn't blink.  They linked arms and said let's do this together.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1037: George can you talk about the long touchdown run but also just the first half maybe how frustrating it was field goals instead of touchdowns?\n",
            "Answer 1037:    Yes in the first half we kicked a couple of field goals and we definitely could have executed better on offense just to score those extra points.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1038: George and Andrew I'm curious this last month has been one of the wildest months really in program history probably.  What will your takeaway be from it George?  And Andrew what your takeaway is?\n",
            "Answer 1038:    You know how strong the team is the perseverance of them.  Continue to stay bought in especially with Coach D.  He's the real deal and he cares truly about us.  And everybody loves him.  So shoutout to Coach D.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1039: George probably played his last game as a Bronco today.  What was it like to see him break that 66yard touchdown run?  What does that do for his legacy moving forward?\n",
            "Answer 1039:    George's legacy has been imprinted for a long time.  It didn't just happen today.  And what he does off the field how he leads how he trains how he's one of the humblest young men I've ever been around and has all the stats to back up to someone who humility is not common.\n",
            "\n",
            "Question 1040: How do you want this team to be remembered?  How are you going to remember this team with everything you overcame this year?  And with it being such a young roster and so much potential talent returning how exciting is the future of this program as well?\n",
            "Answer 1040:    I'm excited.  I believe God is up to something big at Boise State.  And I believe the best is still to come.  It is a legacy that this group of seniors imprinted.  When everybody counted them out  like I said the 45 Broncos was going to be an asterisk year a year everybody looks and frowns upon  this senior class these brothers we have linked arm and said not happening.\n",
